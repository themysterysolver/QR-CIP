# To do project
---
## Phase 1
1. Complete the Permutation scrambling and LSS algorithm
2. Complete Diffusion by parts algorithm
3. Combine the previous 2 modules to prove that the algorithm works
4. Justify the _algorithms_ and methods use
5. Provide image reconstruction metrics to show that the decrypted image is close to the original
---
## Phase 2
1. Figure out how to use blockchain to send the distorted images to the recipient
2. Explain and write-up on the advantages of this technique
---
## Phase 3
1. Develop a working application to demonstrate the project
2. Prove that sniffing the images is hard using a trial network attack
